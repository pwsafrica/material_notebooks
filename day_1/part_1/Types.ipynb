Code is much harder to understand if unexplained numbers appear in it. The reader has to guess what those numbers are supposed to represent. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Readability and changeability\n",
    "It is also makes it much harder to change code later. Imagine if you had to change the number of colors a program could use from 8 to 16 -- you can't search-and-replace `8` in your code with `16` without affecting other parts of the code that happen to use `8` for something else!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Avoid any bare numbers in your code, except when for very simple cases. \n",
    "* Use constants. In Python, these are variables set to a value and not changed afterwards.\n",
    "* If you're counting the number of something (e.g. number of possible colours), use the form `n_[name]`, like `n_colors`, or `n_processing_steps`.\n",
    "* The key point: A constant's name should explain what it means.\n",
    "* It is quite normal to have several constants with the same value; **the constant name explains its purpose, not the value it contains**.\n",
