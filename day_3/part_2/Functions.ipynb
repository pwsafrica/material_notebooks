    "Like most languages, Python has **functions** which achieve three goals:\n",
    "* breaks problems down into small, manageable chunks;\n",
    "* allows problems to be **parameterised**, i.e. to have parts that can **vary in a controlled way**.\n",
    "* isolate variables used in one part of a program from another.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows **abstraction**; finding a general form of problem that means it takes much less work to apply it to a new domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs are broken down into collections of functions. One function calls another, and that function calls another, and so on. This breaks things up into neat, manageable chunks and makes it feasible to write sophisticated programs.\n"

    "## Functions -- calling and returning\n",
    "A function is a block of code -- a sequence of statements. Functions are **called**, which runs the statements in order. Functions often **return** a value; this allows the code that made the call to the function to receive feedback like the result of a calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calling** means to transfer the flow of execution to the function. Control will be returned to the calling code after the function finishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, functions are defined with `def`, called using parentheses `()` and \n",

    "\n",
    "* *Remove repetition*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Repeated code is always a warning something is wrong. When you repeat code: you make it harder and longer to read; you introduce the risk of subtle errors when code is not repeated *exactly*; you waste your own time. Just use a function instead.\n",

    "* *Reason about behaviour*. \n",

    "* *Generalise problems*. \n",
    "\n",
    "We often want to solve problems which are not quite repetitions, but follow a common pattern. For example, we might want to compute the mean, median or mode of a sequence of values, instead of just the mean as the above. We can use parameterisation to create general patterns where the parameters \"fill in the blanks\". We want to avoid having to craft special-cases, and instead reuse simple, general forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Share code*.\n",

    "\n",
    "* *Control effects*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Functions, as we will see, have their own private working areas to do computations. This can be used to isolate computations from each and makes it easier to be sure that code does what you think. By reducing dependence, we can reduce **fragility**.\n",
