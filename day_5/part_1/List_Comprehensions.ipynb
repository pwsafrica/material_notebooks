    "## Elegant functional programming\n",
    "Python (along with Haskell and some other modern languages) has a very elegant way of implementing functional transformations. These are called **comprehensions** and they allow us to specify a transformation from one compound data type to another in terms of operations on each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comprehensions are functional; they represent a \"straight through\" transformation and can have no side-effects whatsoever. Comprehensions cannot make in-place changes to the data types they are working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most importantly, comprehensions are short and easy to read. They precisely and cleanly represent lots of things we might want to do.**. They are also very efficient (because of the strong assumptions Python can make about what they are going to do), often much faster than explicit loops. \n"
